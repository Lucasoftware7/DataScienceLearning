🧐 About the Project

What problem are you solving?

Why is it important (use case, business value, or research value)?

What’s unique about your approach?

💡 Original Idea

Short story of how you came up with the idea.

Any inspiration (papers, blogs, Kaggle competitions, real-world problems).

🛠️ Tech Stack

Languages: Python, R, SQL, etc.

Frameworks/Libraries: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Pandas, etc.

Data: CSV, Parquet, APIs, Databases.

Deployment/Infra (if any): Docker, FastAPI, Streamlit, MLflow, AWS/GCP/Azure.

📂 Data

Source of data (public dataset, scraped, company internal, synthetic).

Size and format of data.

Preprocessing/cleaning steps.

If possible: include a data dictionary (/docs/data_dictionary.md).

⚠️ Note: If data is private, provide sample or instructions to access.

⚙️ Implementation

Explain your workflow step by step:

Data collection / preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering

Modeling approach (algorithms, baselines, hyperparameter tuning)

Evaluation metrics (Accuracy, F1, RMSE, etc.)

Error analysis & limitations

📁 Project Structure

Recommended layout (good practice in DS repos):

project-name/
│
├── data/               <- Raw & processed data (gitignored if large/private)
├── notebooks/          <- Jupyter notebooks for EDA & experiments
├── src/                <- Source code (modules, utils, pipelines)
│   ├── data/           <- Scripts for data loading/preprocessing
│   ├── models/         <- Model definitions and training
│   ├── features/       <- Feature engineering
│   └── visualization/  <- Plotting/analysis code
├── tests/              <- Unit tests
├── docs/               <- Documentation, reports, diagrams
├── requirements.txt    <- Dependencies
├── environment.yml     <- Conda environment (optional)
└── README.md           <- Project overview

📊 Results

Key findings (charts, metrics, tables).

Visuals from notebooks (loss curves, confusion matrix, feature importance).

Comparison with baselines.

🚀 How to Run

Clone repo

git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
cd project-name


Create environment & install dependencies

conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate project-name


or

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run pipeline / main script

python src/train.py

🗺️ Roadmap

 Step 1: EDA

 Step 2: Baseline model

 Step 3: Feature engineering

 Step 4: Model tuning

 Step 5: Deployment / API / Dashboard

✅ Good Practices Other Data Scientists Use

Keep large data out of Git, use .gitignore.

Use requirements.txt + environment.yml for reproducibility.

Modularize code into src/ instead of bloated notebooks.

Add unit tests for data preprocessing and model training.

Save models & metrics (e.g., with MLflow or pickle).

Add a Makefile or scripts for automation.

Provide sample data so others can run quickly.

Write docstrings and comments in code.
